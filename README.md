# Responsive House Slider

We were inspired by the very smooth and elegant animation by <a href="https://dribbble.com/galshir" target="_blank">Gal Shir</a> called 'Responsive House' and we just couldn't resist developing it By using TweenMax, Bootstrap and jQuery we managed to bring this awesome idea into life.
