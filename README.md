# Responsive House Slider

We were inspired by the very smooth and elegant animation by <a href="https://dribbble.com/galshir">Gal Shir</a> called '<a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3499449-Responsive-House">Responsive House</a>' and we just couldn't resist developing it By using TweenMax, Bootstrap and jQuery we managed to bring this awesome idea into life.
